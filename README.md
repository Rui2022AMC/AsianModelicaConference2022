## Important Update: Converted to Virtual Conference

-----------------------------------------------------------------     


The Asian Modelica Conference 2020 is converted to virtual conference considering the current COVID-19 infection status at Tokyo. The conference date is the same as before, October 8–9, 2020. It is organized by [Modelon K.K.](https://www.modelon.com/) in cooperation with Modelica Users Group Japan and [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/).

# About the Conference

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to all of the system simulation standards developed and maintained by the Modelica Association, in particular [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/), the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/), the [System Structure and Parameterization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org/) standard and the [The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org/) standard.

The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. More details about the virtual conference platform will be available soon.

We are looking forward to seeing you online.

Dr. Rui Gao and Dr. Yutaka Hirano

General Chair (Modelon) and Program Chair (Toyota Motor Corporation)

# Call for Papers

Papers and extended abstracts for presentations can be submitted via the EasyChair conference management system:

[EasyChair AsianModelicaConference 2020](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=modelica2020asian)

There, you can also read your reviews and hand in the final paper after the reviewing process has taken place.
In order to submit a paper, you need to have an EasyChair account.
Simply follow the provided instructions to create an account.
The same account can be used for several conferences over several years.
Once you have logged in, please choose option "enter as an author".
You can download the submission templates through easychair or here ([abstract](cfp/abstract-templates-Modelica2020Asian.zip), [paper](cfp/conference-templates-Modelica2020Asian.zip)), or upload your contribution in the section: "New submissions".
Simply follow the instructions.

The paper submission form includes the option to mark suitable topics for your paper. Please use this feature since it helps us to find suitable reviewers for your paper. Furthermore, there is the option to attach a .zip file to your paper. In this way, you can provide example models that correspond to your paper.

The conference proceedings will be published by the Modelica Association on its website and by Linköping University Electronic Press. Each paper will be individually referenced by a DOI.

# Scope of the Conference

The Modelica conference will bring together people using any of the Modelica Association standards for modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, Modelica and/or FMI tool vendors and Modelica library developers. It provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest standards, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:

*  Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with Modelica

*  Free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, ...)

*  Automotive applications

*  Thermodynamic and energy systems applications

*  Mechatronics and robotics applications

*  Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.

*  Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation

*  Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems

*  Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control

*  Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools

*  Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation

*  New features for future Modelica versions

*  Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases etc.)

*  Modelica for teaching and education

*  New features of future FMI versions

*  FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools

*  Tools and applications using the SSP standard

*  Tool and applications using the DCP standard

*  Digital Twins based on MA technologies

In addition, the conference will include Vendors' exhibition.

# Exhibition and Sponsorship

To support the conference, and to get an opportunity to expose their Modelica- and/or FMI-related products and services, vendors will have the opportunity to sponsor the event and to participate in the exhibition. The sponsorship and exhibition will be avialable at the virtual conference as well.

A decision about the acceptance of sponsors and exhibitors will be based upon Modelica/FMI relevance of products and/or services at the time of application submission.

# Important Dates

*  February 16, 2020 Submission of extended abstract (if full paper is submitted, abstract can be skipped)

*  March 1, 2020 Submission of full paper (extended)

*  March 22, 2020 Notification of acceptance for papers

*  August 7, 2020  Submission of final papers

*  August 25, 2020 Switching to virtual conference
